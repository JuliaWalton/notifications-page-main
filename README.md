## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Data Attributes
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

A key learning feature of this project was being able to practice dynamically setting the notification count in response to the "read" or "unread" state of the notifications.

```js
if (attr === "unread") {
  count += 1;
  notificationsCounter.innerHTML = count;

  item.addEventListener("click", () => {
    item.setAttribute("data-read", "read");
    redDot.style.display = "none";
    count -= 1;
    notificationsCounter.innerHTML = count;
    checkCount();
  });
}
```
